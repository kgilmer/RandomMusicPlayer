# RandomMusicPlayer

A simple music player that illustrates how to make a multimedia application
that manages media playback from a service. It allows the user to play music
available on the device or specify a URL from which the media should be
streamed.  It also illustrates how to use the notification system to indicate
an ongoing task and how to deal with audio focus changes.</p>

## Update
This sample also illustrates how to use the
<code><a href="../../../reference/android/media/RemoteControlClient.html">RemoteControlClient</a></code>
class added in API level 14 to integrate with music playback remote controls
such as those found on the lockscreen.

## Update 2

This repo is a copy of https://github.com/android/platform_development/tree/master/samples/RandomMusicPlayer that has been updated to support the Android Runtime Permissions model and some other minor updates to make it run on modern Android devices.
